This weather application allows users to check the current weather, 5-day weather forecast, and additional weather-related data such as air quality, sunrise/sunset times, and more. It is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and integrates with the **OpenWeather API** for weather data.

## Features

- View real-time weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.
- Display 5-day weather forecasts (requires a paid API key or student access).
